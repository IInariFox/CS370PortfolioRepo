# The code created by moi is the Q-learning algorithm code essentially implements Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to train an agent to solve a maze. The agent learns to make decisions (actions) that maximize its cumulative rewards over time, and the Q-values are updated using a neural network. The training continues until a certain win rate is achieved, and the model successfully solves the maze.
# Computer scientist vary in responsibilities. Similair to doctors, there are different types of peoplees in CS with varying jobs. One of the many careers people in CS can go into is data science, machine learning, robotics, electrical ciruit engineering, and a few others related to technology development. People in CS are important to society because they create the software and hardware infrastructure for our the stability of our society such as maintaining power and water, the private industry creating new technology such as computers, cars and AI.
However, as scientists and engineers we have a responsibility to serve the people for their benefit and ultimately give them a great product that does not cross any immoral boundries. It is our responsibility to create rules that do not breach those boundaries that may hurt the end-user physically, mentally, or in any other case.
